    \textbf{Re: Application to Data Scientist position}\\[0.2cm]
    \today, \\[1cm]
    Dear Sir or Madam,
\end{flushleft}
\vspace{0.4cm}

As a highly motivated and meticulous student with strong scientific background
and programming skills, I would like to apply for this Data Scientist position at Datadog.
With my Master of Science and Executive Engineering in Applied Mathematics
from the Ecole des Mines de Nancy, one of the top french engineering school,
I am confident I will be a valuable asset to your team. 
\\[0.5cm]
In a previous role as Data Scientist Intern at Octopeek, I have been given the opportunity to work on a project focused on data enrichment. This project has allowed me to drastically improve my programming skills, and crafting of data-pipelines. Through my work, the project brought new clients with needs.  
\\[0.5cm]
These experiences have allowed me to develop strong time-management and
analytical skills, which I see as being very important when seeking to work
in a highly technical environment. But the most important skill that I earned
is my ability to learn new technologies quickly. 
\\[0.5cm]
With my analytical mind with a solid theoretical foundation, I believe that I have a lot to offer your organization. I am keen to develop my computer science skills and look forward to discussing my application with you at an interview.

Thanking you in advance for your time,
